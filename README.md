1.第一次运行时请耐心等待.mmap文件生成然后使用任务管理器结束进程重新运行，如果你第二次打开时无法检测到fpga设备状态，请确保你的线缆连接没有出错；
2.如果确保你线缆连接没有出错，请删除.mmap文件并重新打开软件，假设此时你打开着APEX，并发现能够识别到进程，但是不能识别到fpga设备，请无视这个状态，继续使用即可。

1. Please wait patiently for the .mmap file to be generated for the first time and then use Task Manager to end the process and re-run, if you can't detect the FPGA device status
when you open it for the second time, please make sure that there is no error in your cable connection;
2. If you make sure that there is no error in your cable connection, please delete the .mmap file and reopen the software, assuming
that you open APEX at this time, and find that the process can be recognized, but not the fpga device, please ignore this state and continue to use.
